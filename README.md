# cnns-auto-comparation
In this project I have tried to do a benchmark comparation between several convolutional neural networks, some of them being predefined from Keras and other being developed from scratch. I am using several dataset: EMNIST, GTSRB, Belgium Traffic Sign(BTS), TSRD(Chinese Traffic Sign), European Traffic Sign Database and Stanford cars
You will find the implementation in the Jupyter Notebook and the other files are for extracting the data from the datasets to use it for training and testing of networks

GTSRB dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign
Stanford cars - https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html
Belgium Traffic Sign(BTS) - https://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/ section Images for Classification
European Traffic Sign - https://github.com/citlag/European-Traffic-Sings -> this link to request access to it -> https://forms.gle/HwyLQtfN3uEpyo8q7
Chinese Traffic Sign(TSRD) - http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/pal/trafficdata/recognition.html

For question you can contact me at adriannmirica@gmail.com and I will gladly help you if I can.
